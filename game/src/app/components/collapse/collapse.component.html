          The players may start by counting to three aloud, or by speaking the
          name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!"), raising one hand in
          a fist and swinging it down with each syllable onto their other hand
          (or in a less common variant, holding it behind their back). They then
          "throw" or "shoot" by extending their selected sign towards their
          opponent on what would have been the fourth count, often saying the
          word "shoot" while doing so. Variations include a version where
          players throw immediately on the third count (thus throwing on the
          count of "Scissors!"), a version including five counts rather than
          four ("Rock! Paper! Scissors! Says! Shoot!", almost exclusively
          localized in the United States to Long Island and some parts of New
          York City), and a version where players shake their hands three times
          before "throwing".

        One popular five-weapon expansion is "rock paper scissors Spock lizard",
        invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to
        the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek
        Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a
        sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is
        poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper Lizard poisons Spock and eats
        paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant
        was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London and was later the
        subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008
        (as rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock).
